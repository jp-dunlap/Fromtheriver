Fromtheriver.org
A living archive of Palestinian history, culture, and the ongoing struggle for liberation.
This repository contains the source code for fromtheriver.org, an interactive resource hub designed to serve as a comprehensive and accessible entry point for education, action, and solidarity with Palestine.
Mission & Philosophy
In an era of overwhelming information and deliberate disinformation, clarity is a revolutionary act. Fromtheriver.org was created not as a simple list of links, but as a guided journeyâ€”an "unfolding map" that connects the roots of history to the branches of present-day action.
Our guiding philosophy is that understanding the struggle for Palestinian liberation requires tracing a path through its history, its culture, its resistance, and the global calls for solidarity. The website's design reflects this, with a central, flowing "river" that connects each theme, inviting the user to explore the deep and interconnected nature of the cause.
This project is an act of digital solidarity, built to be a durable, beautiful, and unapologetic resource for all who seek justice.
Technology Stack
This project is built with a focus on performance, scalability, and modern web standards.
HTML5: For the core structure and content.
Tailwind CSS: For a utility-first, responsive, and highly maintainable styling framework.
JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, including the Intersection Observer API for animations and the dynamic rendering of the SVG "river" path.
The project is deployed via Netlify from this GitHub repository.
