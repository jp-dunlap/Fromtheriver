                        <p>
                            To understand Palestine is to understand a history systematically targeted for erasure. The story does not begin in 1948, but in the soil and soul of a people whose dispossession was planned decades earlier. The British Mandate (1922-1948), established after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, was tasked with guiding Palestine to self-rule. Instead, it implemented the 1917 Balfour Declaration, promising a "national home for the Jewish people" in a land that was already 94% Palestinian Arab. This inherent contradiction set the stage for conflict, privileging the ambitions of a settler movement over the rights of the indigenous majority.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zionism, at its core, is a 19th-century European settler-colonial project. Its foundational premise required the transformation of Palestine into a Jewish state, which could not be achieved without the displacement of the native population. Early Zionist leaders were explicit about this, viewing their work as a "colonization adventure." The lead-up to 1948 saw the systematic execution of this vision, culminating in the Nakba ("The Catastrophe").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1947 UN Partition Plan allocated 55% of Palestine to a Jewish state, despite Jews owning only around 7% of the land and comprising a third of the population. This triggered the 1948 war, during which Zionist militias and later the Israeli army depopulated over 500 Palestinian villages and cities, expelling at least 750,000 people and making them refugees. This was not a byproduct of war; it was the realization of a plan. The Roots of this conflict are found in this violent, ongoing process of ethnic cleansing and land theft.

                        Resistance is the natural and righteous response to occupation and oppression. For Palestinians, it is a continuous, diverse, and deeply-rooted struggle for self-determination and return. It is not a monolith, but a dynamic combination of strategies, from the steadfastness of a farmer on his land to the global call for boycott. To understand the resistance is to understand the Palestinian will to exist.

                    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8">
                        When a colonizing power seeks to erase a people, the preservation of culture becomes an act of war. Every shared meal, every embroidered stitch, every song and dance is a front in the battle for existence. This is not passive tradition; it is *Sumud*—a steadfast refusal to disappear. Palestinian culture is the living, breathing evidence of a nation that colonial logic has failed to expunge. It is the practice of memory, identity, and defiance.

                            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-2">The kitchen is a site of resistance. Dishes like *Maqluba* (the "upside-down" pot of rice, meat, and vegetables) are more than food; they are communal rituals that tell a story of land and family. Sharing these meals asserts a national identity that Israel actively attempts to appropriate and rebrand as its own.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-2">Palestinian embroidery, or *Tatreez*, is a language in thread. The intricate geometric patterns are not merely decorative; they are a visual dialect signifying regional identity, marital status, and ancestral heritage. A dress from Ramallah tells a different story from one from Gaza. This art form literally stitches the map of a fragmented homeland onto the bodies of its people, defying erasure.</p>

The *Dabke's* stomping feet symbolize a connection to the land, while Palestinian cinema gives the people control over their own narrative, challenging the dehumanizing portrayals in Western media.</p>

Search for Palestine solidarity committees, anti-war coalitions, or mutual aid groups in your city, town, or campus. If one doesn't exist, build one.
