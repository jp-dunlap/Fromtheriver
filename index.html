                            To understand Palestine is to understand a history systematically targeted for erasure. The story does not begin in 1948, but in the soil and soul of a people whose dispossession was planned decades earlier. The British Mandate (1922-1948), established after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, was tasked with guiding Palestine to self-rule. Instead, it implemented the 1917 Balfour Declaration, promising a "national home for the Jewish people" in a land that was already 94% Palestinian Arab. This inherent contradiction set the stage for conflict, privileging the ambitions of a settler movement over the rights of the indigenous majority.
                        </p>

                            <button id="open-zionism-modal" class="modal-trigger">Zionism</button>, at its core, is a 19th-century European settler-colonial project. Its foundational premise required the transformation of Palestine into a Jewish state, which could not be achieved without the displacement of the native population. Early Zionist leaders were explicit about this, viewing their work as a "colonization adventure." The lead-up to 1948 saw the systematic execution of this vision, culminating in the Nakba ("The Catastrophe").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1947 UN Partition Plan allocated 55% of Palestine to a Jewish state, despite Jews owning only around 7% of the land and comprising a third of the population. This triggered the 1948 war, during which Zionist militias and later the Israeli army depopulated over 500 Palestinian villages and cities, expelling at least 750,000 people and making them refugees. This was not a byproduct of war; it was the realization of a plan. The Roots of this conflict are found in this violent, ongoing process of ethnic cleansing and land theft.

                        Resistance is the natural and righteous response to occupation and oppression. For Palestinians, it is a continuous, diverse, and deeply-rooted struggle for self-determination and return. It is not a monolith, but a dynamic combination of strategies, from the steadfastness of a farmer on his land to the global call for boycott. To understand the resistance is to understand the Palestinian will to exist.

                <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
                    <p>Sumud (صمود) is an Arabic word meaning "steadfastness" or "resilience." For Palestinians, it is a central strategy of non-violent resistance and a core cultural value. It is the refusal to be erased and the determination to remain on one's land despite immense pressure from the Israeli occupation.</p>
                    <h4 class="font-serif text-xl text-white pt-2">Manifestations of Sumud:</h4>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-400">
                        <li><strong>Clinging to the Land:</strong> Farmers cultivating their olive groves in the face of settler attacks, and families rebuilding their homes after demolition are acts of Sumud.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural Preservation:</strong> Cooking traditional food, wearing and creating Tatreez (embroidery), singing folk songs, and telling Palestinian stories are all ways of resisting cultural erasure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Political & Civil Action:</strong> Participating in protests, documenting human rights abuses, and maintaining social institutions in the face of occupation are forms of collective Sumud.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nurturing Life:</strong> Simply raising a family, educating children, and celebrating life under occupation is a powerful statement of resilience and a rejection of despair.</li>
