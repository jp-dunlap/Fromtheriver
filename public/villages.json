        "summary": "A significant Palestinian Arab village with a history stretching back to the Roman period, al-Birwa was known for its olive groves, two schools (one for boys, one for girls), a mosque, a church, and its revered village shrine. It gained cultural prominence as the birthplace of the Palestinian national poet, Mahmoud Darwish. In early June 1948, the village was initially occupied by Zionist forces during Operation Dekel. Displaying remarkable steadfastness, the villagers, with support from the Arab Liberation Army, staged a counter-attack and recaptured their homes for two days to harvest their crops. However, a much larger Israeli military assault followed, forcing a final, permanent expulsion of all inhabitants. The village was then almost entirely razed to the ground, with the Jewish National Fund (JNF) planting forests over the ruins. The settlements of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on its lands, erasing a center of Palestinian life and culture.",

On July 15-16, 1948, during the second stage of Operation Dekel, the village was attacked by the Israeli army's Sheva' (7th) Brigade. Already demoralized by the fall of the major cities of Acre and Nazareth, many villagers fled under the initial heavy shelling. Those who remained were forcibly expelled by the occupying troops. Following the expulsion, Israeli forces systematically destroyed the village, leaving only a few stone houses and the shrine as desolate reminders of a vibrant community.",

While Israeli sources claim the villagers fled before the attack, Palestinian historians and villagers recount fierce fighting in defense of their homes. Following its capture, a New York Times report confirmed the extensive destruction wrought by 'Jewish demolition squads.' By June 1948, the JNF was already working to completely level the village, an act of erasure that was a key part of the Zionist colonization strategy.",

The majority of the Christian population was initially herded into the village church, while Muslims were expelled to a nearby village.

The village was finally occupied by Irgun forces on May 4, 1948, during Operation Hametz, a day after the Haganah had 'cleansed' the surrounding area. All its inhabitants were expelled. In a clear act of policy aimed at preventing any return, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion received cabinet permission in September 1948 to destroy the village. The Israeli town of Yehud now stands on its ruins.",

This attack initiated a period of intense fear, as Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi forces continued to fire on the village from surrounding high ground. The final expulsion occurred by February 1948 after a campaign of intimidation and strategic destruction of key buildings.

Over 100 villagers—men, women, and children—were systematically killed, many executed in cold blood inside their homes or after being paraded through Jerusalem. The news of the massacre was strategically publicized by the perpetrators to spread terror among the Palestinian population, becoming a pivotal event that accelerated the flight of refugees from other areas.

Over several weeks, they engaged in a campaign of terror and intimidation—including beatings, threats, and nighttime raids—to force all inhabitants to leave.

The bombing caused numerous casualties and widespread panic, prompting the flight of many residents. The remaining villagers were forcibly expelled in the following days. A small number who managed to return were rounded up and expelled again in January 1949, a common practice to ensure permanent depopulation.

This attack initiated a period of intense fear, as Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi forces continued to fire on the village from surrounding high ground. The final expulsion occurred by February 1948 after a campaign of intimidation and strategic destruction of key buildings.

In November, the army ordered the villagers to leave their homes for two weeks for 'security reasons,' promising them they could return. This was a deliberate deception. The villagers were never allowed to return, becoming internally displaced citizens. They waged a decades-long legal battle, and in 1951, the Israeli Supreme Court recognized their right to return. In response, on Christmas Day 1951, the Israeli army completely destroyed the village by shelling it, leaving only the church standing. The case of Iqrit, like that of Kafr Bir'im, is a landmark example of the state's use of military force to defy its own judiciary and prevent the return of Palestinian refugees.",

It was a center of steadfast resistance, holding out for months against Israeli encroachment. It finally fell on July 26, 1948, during the overwhelming assault of Operation Shoter, which involved heavy artillery and air power. After the village's fall, its remaining population was rounded up and expelled, with most forced towards Jinin. In the following weeks, the IDF systematically demolished the village's houses, leaving only the fortress-like home of a notable family and the mosque. The settlement of Kerem Maharal was later established on its lands.",

It was captured on the night of May 22-23, 1948, by the Haganah's Alexandroni Brigade during Operation Namal ('Operation Port'). Following its surrender, a large-scale massacre occurred. Survivor testimonies and research by Israeli scholars have revealed that dozens of unarmed men were systematically executed by the soldiers—lined up and shot on the beach and in the village cemetery. The remaining population was then expelled, with women and children sent to a nearby village and the surviving men taken as prisoners. A mass grave is believed to exist under what is now the parking lot for Dor Beach, a fact that remains a subject of intense denial and controversy in Israel.",

The villagers were expelled, and their homes were destroyed, but the shrine remains. The Israeli settlement of Ramot Naftali was established on its lands.",

Following the massacre, the city's 50,000-70,000 residents (including refugees) were forcibly expelled on foot in a notorious 'death march' towards the Jordanian lines.
