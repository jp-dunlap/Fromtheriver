It gained cultural prominence as the birthplace of the Palestinian national poet, Mahmoud Darwish. In early June 1948, the village was initially occupied by Zionist forces during Operation Dekel. Displaying remarkable steadfastness, the villagers, with support from the Arab Liberation Army, staged a counter-attack and recaptured their homes for two days to harvest their crops. However, a much larger Israeli military assault followed, forcing a final, permanent expulsion of all inhabitants. The village was then almost entirely razed to the ground, with the Jewish National Fund (JNF) planting forests over the ruins. The settlements of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on its lands, erasing a center of Palestinian life and culture.",

On July 15-16, 1948, during the second stage of Operation Dekel, the village was attacked by the Israeli army's Sheva' (7th) Brigade. Already demoralized by the fall of the major cities of Acre and Nazareth, many villagers fled under the initial heavy shelling. Those who remained were forcibly expelled by the occupying troops.

However, Israeli forces immediately violated this provision. Over several weeks, they engaged in a campaign of terror and intimidation—including beatings, threats, and nighttime raids—to force all inhabitants to leave. By April 1949, the entire civilian population had been expelled to Hebron and Gaza. The village was then completely destroyed and the city of Kiryat Gat was built on its lands.",

Its residents were known for their close social and economic ties with Nazareth. The village was occupied on July 15, 1948, during Operation Dekel, just one day before the capture of Nazareth itself. Its inhabitants were expelled, with many taking refuge in Nazareth and Yafa, where they and their descendants live today as 'present absentees'—internally displaced citizens denied the right to return to their homes. The village was completely leveled, with the exception of its two churches (one Greek Catholic, one Roman Catholic) and its mosque, which stand today as stark, lonely witnesses in a pine forest planted over the ruins by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).",

According to Israeli military archives, the village 'put up strong resistance,' which led to an order for a heavy aerial bombardment with 'barrel bombs.' The bombing caused numerous casualties and widespread panic, prompting the flight of many residents. The remaining villagers were forcibly expelled. A small number who managed to return were rounded up and expelled again in January 1949. The Israeli settlement of Tzippori now stands on the site.",
