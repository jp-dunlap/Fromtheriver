      "content_text": "A significant Palestinian Arab village with a history stretching back to the Roman period, al-Birwa was known for its olive groves, two schools (one for boys, one for girls), a mosque, a church, and its revered village shrine. It gained cultural prominence as the birthplace of the Palestinian national poet, Mahmoud Darwish. In early June 1948, the village was initially occupied by Zionist forces during Operation Dekel. Displaying remarkable steadfastness, the villagers, with support from the Arab Liberation Army, staged a counter-attack and recaptured their homes for two days to harvest their crops. However, a much larger Israeli military assault followed, forcing a final, permanent expulsion of all inhabitants. The village was then almost entirely razed to the ground, with the Jewish National Fund (JNF) planting forests over the ruins. The settlements of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on its lands, erasing a center of Palestinian life and culture.",

Its economy was primarily agricultural, focused on grains, olives, and melons, supplemented by the weaving of mats from nearby rushes. On July 15-16, 1948, during the second stage of Operation Dekel, the village was attacked by the Israeli army's Sheva' (7th) Brigade. Already demoralized by the fall of the major cities of Acre and Nazareth, many villagers fled under the initial heavy shelling. Those who remained were forcibly expelled by the occupying troops. Following the expulsion, Israeli forces systematically destroyed the village, leaving only a few stone houses and the shrine as desolate reminders of a vibrant community.",

The village was captured on May 14, 1948, by the Haganah's Carmeli Brigade during Operation Ben-Ami, an offensive designed to 'cleanse' the coast of Western Galilee. While Israeli sources claim the villagers fled before the attack, Palestinian historians and villagers recount fierce fighting in defense of their homes. Following its capture, a New York Times report confirmed the extensive destruction wrought by 'Jewish demolition squads.' By June 1948, the JNF was already working to completely level the village, an act of erasure that was a key part of the Zionist colonization strategy.",

According to survivor testimonies documented by historians, a number of men were then rounded up and summarily executed by Haganah soldiers in a house that was subsequently blown up. The majority of the Christian population was initially herded into the village church, while Muslims were expelled to a nearby village. A few days later, all remaining inhabitants were forcibly expelled at gunpoint across the border into Lebanon, becoming refugees. The village was systematically leveled, though its church and mosque were left standing amidst the rubble.",

The village finally fell on July 16, 1948, during the fierce 'Ten Days' battles that followed the first truce. The assault was notable for being the first coordinated land-sea attack by Israeli forces; a warship bombarded the village from the Mediterranean before ground units from the Golani, Carmeli, and Alexandroni brigades moved in. The remaining villagers were expelled, and the village was almost entirely demolished, with the new Israeli town of Tirat Carmel built over its ruins.",

After its capture, UN investigators documented evidence of atrocities, including the killing of civilians.

Survivor testimonies and research by Israeli scholars have revealed that dozens of unarmed men were systematically executed by the soldiers—lined up and shot on the beach and in the village cemetery. The remaining population was then expelled, with women and children sent to a nearby village and the surviving men taken as prisoners. A mass grave is believed to exist under what is now the parking lot for Dor Beach, a fact that remains a subject of intense denial and controversy in Israel.",

This attack initiated a period of intense fear, as Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi forces continued to fire on the village from surrounding high ground. The final expulsion occurred by February 1948 after a campaign of intimidation and strategic destruction of key buildings. While many of its original stone houses remain standing in an eerie, ghost-like state, they are derelict, and the village has been targeted for luxury development, threatening its physical memory.",

Over 100 villagers—men, women, and children—were systematically killed, many executed in cold blood inside their homes or after being paraded through Jerusalem.

It was a thriving agricultural center with a rich history, a large mosque, a convent, and an orphanage. The village was occupied on the night of July 15-16, 1948, during Operation Dekel. According to Israeli military archives, the village 'put up strong resistance,' which led to an order for a heavy aerial bombardment using 'barrel bombs'—a primitive but devastating weapon. The bombing caused numerous casualties and widespread panic, prompting the flight of many residents. The remaining villagers were forcibly expelled in the following days. A small number who managed to return were rounded up and expelled again in January 1949, a common practice to ensure permanent depopulation. The Israeli settlement of Tzippori now stands on the site.",

The village was captured during Operation Yoav, but its inhabitants were not immediately expelled. They remained in the village until 1950, when they were systematically driven out by Israeli authorities. In a multi-stage expulsion, residents were forcibly transported to the cities of Ramla and Lydda, and from there to refugee camps in the West Bank. The village was then resettled by Jewish immigrants and renamed Zekharia. It stands as a stark example of post-armistice ethnic cleansing.",
